# ü§≥ Catalog App

## Android ü§ñ

You can either run the app from the Android App run configuration in Android Studio, or compile an APK by executing the assemble task in a terminal:
```
./gradlew :catalog:assemble
```

## iOS Ô£ø

To run the iOS catalog app, open the Xcode project located in `<git repo>/iosCatalog` and run it (‚åòR).

## Desktop üñ•Ô∏è

You can run the desktop version by executing the `run` Gradle task in a terminal:
```
./gradlew :catalog:run
```

## Browser üåê

You can access the web catalog app at https://gabrieldrn.github.io/carbon-compose/catalog/index.html. 

Or you can run the web version locally by executing the `wasmJsBrowserRun` Gradle task in a terminal:
