You can either run the app from the Android App run configuration in Android Studio, or compile an APK by executing the assemble task in a terminal:
```
./gradlew :catalog:assemble
```

## iOS Ô£ø

To run the iOS catalog app, open the Xcode project located in `<git repo>/iosCatalog` and run it (‚åòR).

## Desktop üñ•Ô∏è

You can run the desktop version by executing the `run` Gradle task in a terminal:
```
./gradlew :catalog:run
```

## Browser üåê
