/**
 * # Accordion
 *
 * The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive
 * disclosure. The header title gives the user a high level overview of the content allowing the
 * user to decide which sections to read.
 *
 * Accordions can make information processing and discovering more effective. However, it does hide
 * content from users and itâ€™s important to account for a user not noticing or reading all of the
 * included content.
